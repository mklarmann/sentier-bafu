"""Join the finding records with what only the issue tracker knows.

Where a finding stands is computed from the dated evidence in its record (community.stage);
the tracker never decides it. GitHub adds comment counts, last activity, labels, and issues
filed as findings that have no record yet. Without the tracker everything still builds from
the records.
