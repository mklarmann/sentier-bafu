"""Bring the finding issues into agreement with the records: labels, one comment, the state.

    python3 scripts/sync.py            print the differences; write nothing
    python3 scripts/sync.py --apply    write them

The record decides. A finding's status is computed from the dated evidence in its record, and
this job projects it onto the finding's issue:

- labels: `bafu-finding`, exactly one `status: …` label in the words the site shows, and
  `help wanted` while the finding needs a second measurement. An issue filed as a finding
  that has no merged record carries `needs-triage` instead. A label set by hand is put right
  at the next run;
- one comment when the status changes, never two: the comment carries a hidden marker;
- the issue is closed when the status is final (corrected, withdrawn, for information).

Nothing here is a second copy to keep in step: delete every label and run this again, and the
issues say what the records say. Standard library only; `.github/workflows/sync.yml` runs it.
