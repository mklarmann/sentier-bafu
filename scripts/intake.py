"""From an issue to a finding record, and from a comment to a second measurement.

Standard library only. `.github/workflows/intake.yml` runs `intake.py run` and
`intake.py status`. What they do is decided by the functions below, which read no network:

    parse_form(body)                       the fields of an issue filed with the finding form
    record_from_issue(issue, config, ...)  a version 2 record with id F<issue number>, or why not
    command(comment_body)                  /repeated reproduced | /repeated not-reproduced | /record
    second_measurement(record, comment, ...)  the `repeated` block, or why it is refused
    plan(event_name, event, root)          what the workflow does for one event, as plain data
    publish(plan, api)                     carries a plan out through the GitHub API

Everything an issue or a comment says is untrusted:

- it is read from the event file as JSON and never put into a shell command;
- it reaches a record only through the form's fields, with a length limit on each, and the
  record must pass `community.validate_finding`, which refuses raw HTML;
- it is never printed to the job log (a runner reads commands from what a step prints), and
  never copied into a comment, a commit message or a pull request text: those are written
  here, word for word;
- it reaches the site only after a person has merged the pull request.

The headings of the form are a contract with the issues already filed. To rename a heading,
move the old one to EARLIER_FORM; `community/tests/test_intake.py` compares FORM with
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bafu-data-finding.yml`.
