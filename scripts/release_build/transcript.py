"""Keep what a command printed, line for line, with the time of each line.

    python3 scripts/release_build/transcript.py --out FILE -- COMMAND [ARGUMENT ...]

Runs COMMAND and prints every line it writes, unchanged and as it comes, so a job log shows
what it always showed. Beside that it writes FILE: every line with the seconds since the
start, how the command ended, and the SHA-256 of the lines. The site shows that file line
for line (`scripts/last_run.py`, `scripts/sitebuild/lastrun.py`). No line in it is written
by anything but the command.

The file is written however the command ends: with a status other than 0, or stopped by a
signal (a job that is cancelled or runs out of time). The wrapper exits with the command's
status.

    python3 scripts/release_build/transcript.py --keep FILE --into FOLDER [--summary FILE]

Copies a transcript into the folder of the files that may leave the machine. With the run
summary of the patch tool it first checks that no line names who confirmed a problem for
the provider (`public_summary.py` says why). A transcript is never edited: one that names
somebody is not copied, and the status is 1.

Standard library only, and it runs on the Python a runner has.
