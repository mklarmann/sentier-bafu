"""The last run of a workflow, as GitHub and the run itself recorded it.

    python3 scripts/last_run.py --repository owner/name --out FILE
    python3 scripts/last_run.py --local --summary run.json --transcript transcript.json --out FILE

Which workflow, and what it is called on the page, is said in `site/config.json`:

    "run": {
      "name": "Build",                       what a run is called: "Build 4 of ..."
      "workflow": "build.yml",               the workflow whose last run is shown
      "artifact": "build-results",           the artifact that holds run.json and transcript.json
      "tagged": {"job": "Keep", "tags": "v"}                    optional: see below
    }

For that workflow of one repository this reads

- GitHub's own record of the last run that has ended: its number, its commit, what started
  it, how it ended, and every step with its result. Anyone can read this.
- what that run kept in its artifact: `run.json`, the run's own account of its steps
  (`scripts/runrecord/summary.py`), and `transcript.json`, every line it printed
  (`scripts/runrecord/transcript.py`). Reading an artifact needs a token (`actions: read`).

and returns one record. The site shows it as it is (`scripts/sitebuild/lastrun.py`): the last
run, not the last run that worked. A run that failed is shown as failed, with the step and
the reason; a run that kept nothing is shown with what GitHub recorded about it.

`tagged` is for a workflow that also runs for a tag and then keeps its result under that
tag: `job` is how the name of the job that keeps it begins, `tags` how such a tag begins.
What is kept under such tags is then read as well, with its files, and the page says where
this run stands as to that.

`--local` makes the record of a run that did not happen on GitHub, from the two files the
run wrote: a run on a machine that holds what a public runner may not hold. GitHub has no
record of such a run, and the record says so; the page shows it marked as such.

Nothing here is trusted because it came from a run: the two files are read with limits and
checked for their shape, a key the formats do not know is refused, and the site escapes
every text of them.

    state       read | no run | not read | unreadable
    kept        read | none | expired | needs a token | unreadable     (when state is read)

Standard library only. `transport` and `fetch` are how requests leave the process; the tests
pass recorded answers, and nothing in the tests reaches the network.
