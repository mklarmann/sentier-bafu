"""The last run of a workflow as the opening of a page: whether it worked, what is blocking,
what was in it, and the run itself, step by step, with every line it printed.

Everything is read from the record of scripts/last_run.py: GitHub's record of the run, and
the two files the run kept, its own account (run.json) and its transcript. Which workflow
that is, and what its runs are called, is said in site/config.json under "run". Three rules
hold the page to the run:

- No sentence states a result the record does not hold. A run without an account of its own
  is shown with what GitHub recorded and nothing more.
- A number is never typed. What a step does is told in site/run-steps.json, in plain words
  and without a number; every figure beside it, and every note, is the run's own account.
- The lines of the transcript are the run's own. Each is escaped for HTML and is otherwise
  unchanged; a step only groups them, in their order. A test compares the page with the
  transcript line by line.

Nothing here knows a dataset or a tool: a step is what the run names, with the words the
site's own file has for it. A step the run says it could not run in this place ("not run
here") is drawn as open, with the run's reason, and is no failure. A run that did not happen
on GitHub is shown marked as such.
